1 In the beginning God created the visible and invisible. 2 Now the visible was formless and empty, invisible was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the editor.

3 And God said, “Hello World!,” and there was an output. 4 God saw that the output was good, and he separated the visible from the invisible. 5 God called the output “client,” and the invisible he called “server.” And there was frontend, and there was backend—the first page.
