The Biginning
In the beginning God created the visible and invisible. Now the visible was formless and empty, invisible was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the editor.

And God said, “Hello World!,” and there was an output. God saw that the output was good, and he separated the visible from the invisible. God called the output “client,” and the invisible he called “server.” And there was frontend, and there was backend—the first page.


Noah and Y2K
This is the account of Noah and his websites.
Noah was a righteous man, a full stack, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God. Noah could build anything he could have imagined.

Now the web was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of violence.  God saw how corrupt the web had become, for all the people on web had corrupted their ways. So God said to Noah, “I am going to put an end to all people, for the web is filled with two-digit field for years because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the web.
