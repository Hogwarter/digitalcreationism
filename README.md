### About Me
I'm a Japanese designer living Tokyo. I have been designing web apps, mobile apps, and some graphic design stuff. 
I have very little experience with GitHub and programming, so I may need your help organizing the project here!

### About the project
This is a project started on Oct 20, 2017. 
Nothing serious, I thought it would be fun to write the whole new Bible in digital context.
There is no intention of offending enyone. I ofcourse respect Jewishism and Christianity :)

### Where is this going?
There is no set direction or what the content would be, but here's some ideas:
- Create a website
- Have the text in English and Japanese
- Old Testament: up until the end of Web 2.0
- New Testament: after Steve Jobs
- Apocalypse: Singularity
