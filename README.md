# digitalcreationism

### About Me
I'm a Japanese designer living Tokyo. I have been designing web apps, mobile apps, and some graphic design stuff. 
I have very little experience with GitHub and programming, so I may need your help organizing the project here!

### About the project
This is a project started on Oct 20, 2017. 
Nothing serious, I thought it would be fun to write the whole new Bible in digital context.
There is no intention of offending enyone. I ofcourse respect Jewishism and Christianity :)

### Basic Rules
- Anyone can commit and send push
- Anyone can update the contents
- BUT do not include followings: racism, sexism, violence, or political contents
